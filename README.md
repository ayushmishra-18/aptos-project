Civic Engagement Credits
📖 Description

The Civic Engagement Credits smart contract is built on the Aptos Move language to encourage and track students’ participation in civic activities. It allows institutions or authorized authorities to verify activities and award credits to students, promoting accountability and recognition of social contributions.

The contract provides two key functions:

init_record → Initializes a student’s record with 0 credits.

award_credit → Allows an authority to award credits to a student for verified civic activities.

🌍 Vision

The project envisions a transparent, blockchain-powered system to acknowledge and promote civic participation. By integrating civic credits into academic or institutional frameworks, students can build a social impact portfolio that reflects their contributions to the community.

🚀 Future Scope

Integration with Academic Systems → Credits can be tied to course outcomes or extracurricular achievements.

Reputation System → Extend credits to create a decentralized civic reputation score.

Interoperability → Enable institutions, NGOs, and local governments to contribute to a shared ecosystem of verified civic activities.

Gamification → Leaderboards, badges, and tokenized rewards for higher engagement.

Mobile DApp → A student-friendly interface for tracking credits and activities.
